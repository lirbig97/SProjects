Iris Dataset
================
Gibril

# Introduction

Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset is famous for testing different classification
algorithms. It contains measurements (in cm) of sepal length and width
and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers of the 3 Iris
species (Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

The aim of this project is to use various supervised learning techniques
to classify the species of a given Iris flower. We are purely interested
in the accuracy of the methods used given that the classes are balanced.

# Dataset

The dataset is freely available on the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). It includes 50
samples of each of the three species and some measured properties about
each flower. As will be seen the graphs below, one flower species can be
linearly separated from the other two whereas the other two are not
linearly separable from each other.

The variables in the datasets are:

  - Id
  - SepalLengthCm
  - SepalWidthCm
  - PetalLengthCm
  - PetalWidthCm
  - Species
      - Iris-setosa
      - Iris-versicolor
      - Iris-virginica

The graph below show the distributions and pairwise relationships of the
continuous variables in the dataset.

And finally, a correlation matrix of the variables in the dataset (excl.
Id). The new variable `SpecNum` is the coded version of the `Species`
variable.

|               | SepalLengthCm | SepalWidthCm | PetalLengthCm | PetalWidthCm | SpecNum |
| ------------- | ------------: | -----------: | ------------: | -----------: | ------: |
| SepalLengthCm |         1.000 |      \-0.109 |         0.872 |        0.818 |   0.783 |
| SepalWidthCm  |       \-0.109 |        1.000 |       \-0.421 |      \-0.357 | \-0.419 |
| PetalLengthCm |         0.872 |      \-0.421 |         1.000 |        0.963 |   0.949 |
| PetalWidthCm  |         0.818 |      \-0.357 |         0.963 |        1.000 |   0.956 |
| SpecNum       |         0.783 |      \-0.419 |         0.949 |        0.956 |   1.000 |

The table shows that `Species` is highly correlated to `SepalLengthCm`,
`PetalLengthCm` and `PetalWidthCm`. From the above scatterplot matrix,
we see that these variables can be used to classify `Species` with less
error and so will be prioritised in variable selection.
